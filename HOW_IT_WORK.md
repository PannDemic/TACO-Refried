* TACO reads your game log for combat monitor and chatlog for intel channel
* intel channel has been setted to TACO before this tool published(GOTG intel channel has been added to TACO,you can check at [Config]->[Channels]
* when somebody linked a system or some text you setted up as trigger,TACO will play some noisy to notify you something happen
* when 30 seconds after your combat finished,TACO will play some noisy to remind you(if you enable the anomaly monitor)
* custom text alert work both for chatlog and gamelog,it means that if you set the boss's name as the trigger text,when a boss burn and attacked you,TACO will do some noisy as wll
